#Portfolio Website

This is a simple portfolio website built using HTML and basic CSS. The website consists of two main pages:

Home: Provides an overview of my skills, projects, and personal introduction.
Contact: A page for visitors to get in touch with me through a contact form or find links to my social profiles.
The goal of this project was to create a minimalist and clean design that is both functional and easy to navigate. Check out the live demo of the website or explore the code to see how itâ€™s structured.
